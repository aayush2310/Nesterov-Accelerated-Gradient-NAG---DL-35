It is a solution of the oscillations we observed in momentum GD.
oscillations are damped(reduced)

The difference in NAG is about the gradient update will be calculated at which position.

In NAG we dont apply gradient and momentum at the same point,we first apply momentum and move to a lower point(look ahead term) and then we apply gradient at that lower 
point.Thus oscillation is reduced.

Disadvantage:-
NAG dampens oscillation,so we might get struck at local minima,but in momentum one it was not there.
